# Big Data Mining – Home Exam

This project was conducted as part of my **Big Data Mining** course and focuses on applying data mining and machine learning techniques to analyze large-scale datasets.  
Throughout the project, I aimed to understand how advanced statistical and computational tools can uncover meaningful patterns hidden within complex data, and how these insights can support predictive modeling and decision-making processes.

At the first stage, I explored and cleaned the raw dataset, handled missing values, and transformed variables to prepare the data for modeling.  
This process required careful examination of data distributions, correlations, and feature importance to ensure the models were both accurate and interpretable.  
I then implemented several supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, comparing their ability to detect trends, classify observations, and predict target outcomes under different conditions.

In addition to the technical implementation, I focused on evaluating the models using appropriate statistical metrics and visualization techniques.  
The analysis included examining accuracy, precision, recall, and other measures that reflect the predictive strength and generalization ability of each model.  
The results provided valuable insights into which methods perform best in large-scale, noisy, and multidimensional environments.

The final report presents the entire research workflow – from data preprocessing and modeling to discussion of results and conclusions.  
It demonstrates not only the practical application of data mining concepts but also critical reasoning and interpretation of outcomes, combining statistical understanding with a data-driven mindset.  
All visualizations, tables, and figures are included in the PDF report to illustrate the main findings in a clear and concise manner.
